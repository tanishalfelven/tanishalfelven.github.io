			<hr />
			<p>Welcome to <strong><a href="http://tanishalfelven.github.io">tanishalfelven.github.io</a></strong>, you are laying your eyes on the first post, ever. Aren't you just a special cookie?</p>
			<p>Now you might be wondering, where the in the <em>nine hells</em> have I found myself? I apologize if you don't mean to be here, and in the sad case that you are not a programmer (or some creature similar in design), you may show yourself out. <em>Or</em> stay. You might learn something.</p>
			<p>Ah, but I've still avoided the question. This is <em>my site</em>. My <em>domain</em><sup id="fnref:notreally"><a href="#fn:notreally" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. This is where I <strong>lurk</strong>. This is where I'll post everything. The games I create, the tutorials for things I discover (Or perhaps just an improvement on what is already available), and of course this blog.</p>
			<p>Now that sounds <em>nice and dandy</em>, but who exactly is this <strong>Half-Elf</strong>?</p>
			<p>I am Tanis Half-Elven. I'm a programmer. I like to program. I <em>love</em> to <em>program</em>. I <em>love</em> to solve problems. I <em>love</em> to read other programming blogs. I <em>like</em> to find problems, and fix them. I <em>like</em> Open Source Work, and try to contribute to it when I've got the time. I <em>like</em> learning. I <em>like</em> to learn with other programmers, whether they are less or more experienced doesn't matter, as long as they have <strong><em>the</em></strong> work ethic. I <em>like</em> to spend long hours trying to figure out a bug from a simple division error, that is stupidly obvious once found<sup id="fnref:youknow"><a href="#fn:youknow" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. I <em>like</em> to design interfaces, and fret about using sans-serif or serif fonts. </p>
			<p>I enjoy all of this.</p>
			<p>I am a programmer. I want to work hard, and continually create and learn. </p>
			<p>This is where you can find me. This is <em>my domain</em>.</p>

			<p>Okay, okay, you caught me, it's really github's domain. My <em>sub-domain</em>, Mwu-ha-ha!&#160;<a href="#fnref:notreally" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
